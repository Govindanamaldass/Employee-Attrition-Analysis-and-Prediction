# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction

This is my mini-project where I worked on predicting employee attrition. The main idea is to analyze employee data and find out who might leave the company, and what factors are causing it. what i did is as follows: 1:Collected and cleaned the employee dataset 2:Explored the data to understand patterns and trends in attrition. 3:Built two machine learning models – Logistic Regression and Random Forest – to predict attrition. 4:Compared the models and picked the better one based on accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. 5:Created a simple Streamlit app where I can Upload a CSV of employee data and see predictions and Check the top factors that lead to attrition. Key Findings from this project are : Employees working overtime, at certain job levels, or with long total working years are more likely to leave. Some roles like Laboratory Technicians also showed higher attrition risk. These insights can help HR teams take preventive steps like workload balancing or offering career growth plans.
